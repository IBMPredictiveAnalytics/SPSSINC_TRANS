<h1>Apply a Python Expression to the Case Data</h1>
<p>  This procedure
  applies a Python expression to the cases in the active dataset and
  saves the results in one or more variables. The variables can be
  existing or created new. This allows you to tap Python functionality
  from the standard Python library, from IBM-supplied modules,
  or from modules you or others create almost as if these functions were
  built in to the IBM® SPSS® Statistics transformation system.
<div class="syntax">
SPSSINC TRANS RESULT=<em>variables</em><sup>&#42;</sup> TYPE=<em>numbers</em> USERMISSING=ASIS<sup>&#42;</sup> or SYSMIS<br/>
/INITIAL <em>i-expression</em><br/>
/VARIABLES <em>variables</em></br/>
/FORMULA &ldquo;<em>f-expression</em>&rdquo;<sup>&#42;</sup><br/>
</p>

<p><sup>&#42;</sup> Required<br/>
<sup>&#42;&#42;</sup> Default</p>
</div>
<p>Example:
Execute the function <em>f</em> in a Python module named <em>mytrans</em> with inputs <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC TRANS RESULT=sum2 TYPE=0
/FORMULA &quot;mytrans.f(x=salary, y=10000.)&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>RESULT</strong> defines the names for the result variables.  Typically there is only one, but
a function can return multiple values.  If fewer values than requested are returned for a case,
the values are filled out with sysmis or blank, according to the result type.  If too many values are returned,
the command stops with an error message.</p>

<p><strong>TO</strong> can be used in the result list with the following rules.  </p>

<ul>
<li>If the variables in TO exist, TO is expanded in the usual way to that list of variables in file order.</li>
<li>If the variables do not exist, and they have the same root and numerical suffixes, they are
expanded in numerical order.  For example,
<code>a b c01 to c03 d</code>
expands to
<code>a b c01 c02 c03 d</code>
if c01 and c03 do not exist.
Either both or neither of the TO variables must exist.  Any preexisting variables in the
expanded list will be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TYPE</strong> specifies the type codes for the result variables.  0, the default, means numeric.
Positive integer values mean a string of that length, measured in bytes.  There must be as many type 
codes as there are result variables, except that the entire list can be omitted if 
all values are to be numeric, and a single number can be specified to apply to 
the entire result list.  Types will be changed for existing variables if necessary.</p>

<p>If TO is used in the result list, exactly one type code for the group should be specified if
a number list is provided.</p>

<p>Type changes happen BEFORE the data are passed, so the Python code 
should expect to see values in that representation if overwriting existing variables.
Note that some type changes destroy the values.</p>

<p>System missing values are converted to Python <em>None</em>.  By default, user missing
values are left as is.  Specify <strong>USERMISSING</strong>=SYSMIS to convert these to the
sysmis value (<em>None</em>) before calling the formula function.</p>

<p>For Python programmers, a dictionary of user missing values can be accessed as<br/>
<code>sys.modules[&quot;SPSSINC_TRANS&quot;].MISSINGS</code>.<br/>
It can be used to work with individual variable missing values like this toy example, which
just tests a specific variable for any type of missing value.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>begin program.
from spssdata import ismissing
def anymissing(x):
    mvs = sys.modules[&quot;SPSSINC_TRANS&quot;].MISSINGS[&#39;X1&#39;]
    return  ismissing(x, mvs)
end program.
spssinc trans result = x1missing
/formula &quot;anymissing(X1)&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>This only makes sense if USERMISSING = ASIS, since otherwise you can just
test for None.  That allows for more selective handling of user missings.</p>

<h2>FORMULA</h2>

<p><strong>f-expression</strong> is the formula to evaluate.  <ul>
  <li>The
  entire formula should be quoted.  Use the alternate type of quotes within the
  formula or follow the regular Statistics quoting rules.</li>
  <li>The formula must be a single expression, not a statement.</li>
  <li>Variable names must be valid as Python identifiers.  This means
  primarily that they cannot contain a period.  Since Python 3 is entirely Unicode,
  almost any name valid in Statistics is allowed.  Nonconforming variable names
  must be renamed in order to use them in the expression.</li>
  <li>Unlike in Statistics, variable and function names as well as module names are case sensitive.</li>
  <li>Almost any Python modules and functions can be specified, with the parts
  separated by a period.  E.g., re.search would refer to the search function in the regular expression
  module.  In addition there are built-in Python functions that can be called without a module qualifier.
  Here is a list of some that might be useful.  Consult Python documentation for details.</br>
  abs, all, any, ascii, bin, bool, bytearray, bytes, chr, complex, divmod, enumerate, filter, float, format, hash, hex, int, isinstance, len, list, map, max, min, oct, open, ord, pow, range, repr, reversed, round, set, setattr, slice, sorted, str, sum, type, zip.</li>
  <li>Python modules referred to in the formula are automatically imported into Python.  If a function is referred to
  other than the builtin ones, without a module name, an attempt is made to import it from a preceding BEGIN PROGRAM PYTHON block, but
  it can also be qualified by the module name "__main__", so __main__.f would refer to the user-written function f 
  defined in any preceding BEGIN PROGRAM block.</li>
  <li>This is an example of a function reference:
  
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">sample.f(x=firstvar, y=secondvar)</span></p>

  firstvar and secondvar would be variable names in the active
  dataset and f would be automatically imported from the sample module.
  Here is an example that counts the number of occurrences of "a" in variable y.
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">spssinc trans result = inline 
    /formula "re.findall('a', y).count('a')".</span></p>
More directly, you could do this.
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">spssinc trans result = inline 
    /formula "len(re.findall('a', y))".</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>As a shorthand, a list of variable names can be entered in the Variables field and referred
  to in the formula as
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">&lt;></span></p>
  It will be expanded to a comma-separated list of names.  For example,
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">sample.f(<>)</span></p> would be expanded to
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=
  "code">sample.f(x,y,z)</span></p> if the Variables field is x TO z.</li>
  <li>A class can also be referred to via the INITIAL subcommand, in which case the classes' __init__ method will be called first.  See details below.</li>
  <li>The operators and grouping characters in Python are mostly consistent with SPSS Statistics, but while /
is the same as in SPSS, // is used to refer to integer division, and % is the modulus operator.
There are additional operators in Python, particularly for bitwise operations.</li>

  <li>Function argument values can be IBM SPSS
  Statistics variable names, numbers, constants, string literals or expressions
  using these.</li>
  <li>Literal strings must be enclosed in single or double quotes.</li>

  <li>A set of values can be passed as a list
  to a function by enclosing them in square brackets--for example,
  parm=[x,y,z].</li>

  <li>Consult the documentation for the
  function you want to use to determine how to call it.</li>
  <li>While the formula must be an expression, not a statement, expressions can
  include some things that look like a statement.  For example,</br>
  spssinc trans result=newsal<br/>
    /formula "x * 1.05 if y == 1 else x * 1.10".
<p>There is one ambiguous situation in which the formula may fail
in a puzzling way.  Suppose there is a function named f1 used, and
there is also a variable named f1 somewhere in the formula.
 This will likely fail, because the Python interpreter does not know when
f1 refers to the function and when it refers to the variable when the transformation is executed.  (It is legal in Python to pass a function name as an argument to a function.)

<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
<p>The VARIABLES subcommand can be used to create a Python variable list in 
the formula or initial expression that supports SPSS rules.<br/>
It allows the use of TO but
all the variables must already exist (since these are inputs).<br/>
To refer to the variable list in the formula or initial expressions, use
<code>&lt;&gt;</code> in that expression.  For example,</p>

<pre><code>/VARIABLES= V1 TO V3
/FORMULA &quot;somefunc(&lt;&gt;, parm=100)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>would be interpreted as</p>
<p><code>/FORMULA &quot;somefunc(V1, V2, V3, parm=100)&quot;</code></p>
</p>

<h2>INITIAL</h2>
<p><strong>INITIAL</strong> can be used to construct a function, which must be named <em>func</em>, that can be
used in the f-expression.  The expression must be a class constructor, and it will usually
have a different parameter list from the evaluation function.  Here is an example
using the vlookup function in extendedTransforms.  The SPSS-supplied
  module <i>extendedTransforms</i> is installed with Statistics.  It contains over 30
  functions appropriate for variable transformations.</p>

<pre><code>SPSSINC TRANS RESULT=resultcode TYPE=0
/INITIAL &quot;extendedTransforms.vlookup(key=&#39;key&#39;, value=&#39;value&#39;, dataset=&#39;lookup&#39;)&quot;
/FORMULA func(x).
</code></pre>

<p><em>vlookup</em> takes a dataset defining a lookup table with key as the lookup key and value
as the result.  This class returns the actual lookup function named func which is
then used in the f-expression.  There can be only one func in the command.</p>

<p>Since the INITIAL class can have a different parameter list, it provides a convenient
way to specify parameters that are only needed at initialization time.
The i-expression is only called once and does not participate in the case-
processing loop.</p>

<p>The INITIAL expression cannot refer to SPSS variables as they are undefined to the procedure
at this point.  If you use the <code>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</code> construct in the initial call, the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
is expanded, but to avoid undefined variables, the list needs to be quoted
just as would be required if an explicit list of SPSS variables was given.
For example,<br/>
<code>/VARIABLES salary salbegin /INITIAL   &quot;C(&#39;&lt;&gt;&#39;)&quot;</code><br/>
would be expanded to<br/>
<code>C(&#39;salary, salbegin&#39;)</code><br/>
and the <code>__init__</code> function could use this as appropriate.  The class __init__ method
should construct a function named func that can be referred to in the f expression.
Here is a complete,
example using an inline class definition.  The result is to
compute the mean of the listed variables.  In this case, of course,
the result could be computed more directly.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>BEGIN PROGRAM PYTHON.
class C(object):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.numvar = len(args[0].split(&quot;,&quot;))
        def f(*args):
            return sum(args)/self.numvar
        self.func = f
end program.

spssinc trans result=nsum
/variables salary salbegin
/INITIAL   &quot;C(&#39;&lt;&gt;&#39;)&quot;
/FORMULA   &quot;func(&lt;&gt;)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Python escape sequences such as \t are expanded in the final value.  Thus a \t would become
a tab character.  <strong>LITERALESCAPES</strong>=YES causes these values to be protected with
an extra backslash (the repr value).  This will, of course, make the string longer.</p>

<p>The capitalization of the module, function, and parameter names must match the
function definition.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC TRANS RESULT=datestring TYPE=30
FORMULA extendedTransforms.datetimetostr(value=adatevar, pattern=&#39;&#39;&#39;%A, %B %d, %Y&#39;&#39;&#39;).</code></pre>

<p>This calls the function <em>datetimetostr</em> in the <em>extendedTransforms</em> module, which converts an
SPSS date value to a string according to the pattern<br/>
dayname, monthname day-of-month, 4-digit-year 
and stores the result in the variable <em>datestring</em>, which is made to be a string of length 30.</p>

<p>The parameter names will depend on the particular function called.</p>

<h2>String Methods</h2>
When using string methods such as split, endswith, capitalize or any of the others,  refer to them as the str module, eg., str.split(x, ",") rather than method syntax such as s.split(",").  Otherwise, the parser may handle them incorrectly.

<h2>The Walrus Operator</h2>
The walrus operator was introduced in Python 3.8 to allow a variable assignment as a side effect
of a test, among other uses.  The formula in SPSSINC TRANS can only be a single expression, so
using := makes more complex formulas possible without resorting to a separate BEGIN PROGRAM block
or excessive code repetition.  Variables created by := are not treated as SPSS variables in
evaluating the formula.
Here is an example of extracting a four-digit year from a string variable that might contain IT while assigning -99 for a
missing value code. The input is variable datetext, and the FORMULA subcommand would be<br/>
<pre class="example"><code>FORMULA
"z.group(0) if (z := re.search(r'\d\d\d\d', datetext)) else -99"
</code></pre>
<p>The search function returns a match variable containing information about the match, z, or None if there is no match.
The group function extracts the matched text, and the if condition ensures that the
returned value is -99 when no year was found.  Notice that the walrus assignment part is enclosed in parentheses, which are generally necessary when using it.


<h3>For Function Authors</h3>

<p>A variable named <em>FIRST</em> is set True when the function is first called in case the
function needs to do some one-time initialization.  It can be accessed as<br/>
<code>sys.modules[&quot;SPSSINC_TRANS&quot;].FIRST</code></p>

<p>Set it to False on the first call.  Suggested code would resemble this;</p>

<pre class="example"><code>    try:
        if sys.modules[&quot;SPSSINC_TRANS&quot;].FIRST:
            print &quot;first call&quot;
            sys.modules[&quot;SPSSINC_TRANS&quot;].FIRST = False
    except:
        pass
</code></pre>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>Although this command operates similarly to the standard IBM
  SPSS Statistics transformation language, unlike, for example, the
  COMPUTE command, each SPSSINC TRANS command requires a data pass.
  This command cannot be used inside an IBM SPSS Statistics
  transformation block such as DO IF.</p>
  
   <p>IBM SPSS Statistics numerical values are always passed to the
  Python code as floating point numbers. Use the Python int
  function if the function you are calling requires an int for an
  IBM SPSS Statistics value, but note that sysmis values are seen
  by Python as None values and cannot be passed to the int
  function.</p>

<h2>Historical Note</h2>
Earlier versions of this command limited the types of expressions that
could be processed.  The present vesion is much more general.  It also
has more helpful error messages.</p>
